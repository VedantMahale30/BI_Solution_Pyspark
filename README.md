# Hadoop-Based Business Intelligence Solution
Project Overview:

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Business Intelligence (BI) solution using the Hadoop ecosystem. It showcases efficient data ingestion, transformation, and visualization workflows. The objective is to process large-scale datasets and extract actionable insights for dashboards and machine learning (ML) pipelines.

Features:

Scalable Data Processing: Utilizes HDFS for distributed storage and Spark for in-memory computation.
Efficient Data Transformation: Employs PySpark SQL to clean, join, and transform datasets for BI and analytics.
Data Warehousing: Stores processed data in Hive tables for querying and reporting.
Insights and Visualization: Supports BI dashboards and ML-ready datasets for predictive analytics.

Project Architecture:

The solution integrates the following Hadoop ecosystem components:

HDFS: Distributed storage for raw and processed data.

Apache Spark: In-memory processing for transformations and aggregations.

Apache Hive: Data warehousing and ad-hoc querying.

YARN: Resource management and job scheduling.

Hue/Power BI/Tableau: Visualization tools for insights.

Workflow:

1. Data Ingestion
Upload raw CSV files (e.g., loan.csv) to HDFS.
Validate schema consistency and data integrity.
2. Data Transformation
Clean data: Handle null values, duplicates, and type mismatches.
Join datasets: Enrich raw data with customer and regional information.
Aggregations: Generate key metrics for BI dashboards.
3. Data Warehousing
Store cleaned data in Hive tables for optimized querying.
Apply partitioning and bucketing strategies to enhance query performance.
4. Visualization
Export aggregated data for use in Power BI/Tableau.

Technologies Used:

HDFS,
Apache Spark (PySpark SQL),
Apache Hive,
YARN,
Visualization Tools: Tableau, Power BI,
Languages: Python, SQL
